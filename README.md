# Gale-Shapley stable matching

Overview:

Initially, all individuals are unmarried. An unmarried man m chooses
the woman w who is at the top of his preference list and proposes to her. The
woman remains engaged from the point at which she receives her Ô¨Årst
proposal; and the sequence of partners to which she is engaged gets better and
better (in terms of her preference list). The G-S algorithm terminates after at 
most n^2 iterations of the While loop.[1]

Problem:

[2]Prepare an algorithm implementation in some programming language, and read the preferences from a file. 
Be attentive to the data structures you select for your solution.
Determine the time complexity of your algorithm.
Submit the source code of your program and a screenshot of your program running.
